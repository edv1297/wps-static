            <p>Hello, my name is William, and photography is my passion. I have been taking photographs since I was 20 years old in Cuba. Since then, a lot has changed. Photography went from film to digital. There have been several trends that I have witnesses and learned from as time has passed. 
              After emigratting to the U.S. I worked several jobs while continuing to do some photography work on the side. Eventually, I built up my business and was able to do photography full time.
            <p>I love what I do because every new client is a creative journey. Starting with creating their custom package up until when the final product is delivered, I always try to better myself and innovate. Most clients <span><a href ="../../pages/clients/index.html">claim</span> that they xlove my work.</a></p>
            <p> Thanks for visiting my site, if you have any questions please <span><a href = "../../pages/contact/index.html">reach out.</a></span> Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
